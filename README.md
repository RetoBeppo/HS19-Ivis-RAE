### What is relative age effect? 

Relative Age Effect (RAE) is used to show the tendency, that the number of teammembers is higher amongst those born early in the selection period than would be expected from the normalised distribution of live births. 
RAE is a well known problem during the development of youthplayers for the first team. 

### Selection and drop-out rate

The selection period for footballacademies is usually the sporting season. There is one team per age-group. 
The drop-out decreases with the age. For example, at the youth academy of FC Basel, the drop-out rate from the U11-team to the U13 is at 34 %. The drop-out rate from the U15 to U18 is at 19%.
Due to the fact that the teams are age-grouped, players born in the 1st quarter of the year are almost a year further in physical development than those born in the last quarter. This difference plays a very big role, especially in puberty. Due to that, the relative age effect is more noticeable in younger years. 
Due to the strong selection in the lower age groups, players born later in the year have lower chances of being included in the squad for the next season.

### Countermeasure

The problem with this type of selection is that clubs can potentially lose highly talented players due to physical backwardness. As the Swiss Football Association is aware of the problem and the clubs have been made aware of it, countermeasures have been taken. 

In 2017, the Swiss Football Association instructed the youth academies of the Swiss clubs to start using quotas for the selection process. This quota means that at least a quarter of the team must be born in the second half of the year. In addition, clubs now have the opportunity to place children born late in the year in the lower age group.

## ❯ Projectapproach

The data analysis and visualisation of the results will be based on data from the Youth Academy of FC Basel. The U18 and U21 teams from the 2009 to 2019 season will be analysed. These two teams are the oldest teams before the transition to professional football. In these teams the selection is almost complete and the team composition is stable. Therefore it is possible to check how the selection for RAE has been done so far.

Since the Swiss Football Association did not introduce the quota requirements until 2017, the same analysis would have to be repeated in about 5 years to see if the countermeasures had the desired effect.

### Datasource

The data for the analysis is obtained from transfermarkt.ch.

### Visualsation

The collected data is compared to the normalised distribution of live births. The charts can be filtered by season and age.
Also per team and per season a breakdown of the birth data is created, which shows the team composition distributed over the individual quarters.
